### Motivation

Veryfying if a character has completed certain achievements in Blizzard's World of Warcraft can be difficult without logging into the game. Fortunately. Raider.IO has developed a comprehensive API that offers many fast-check fields.

This application uses this API to allow users the *v1/character* section to query whether they have completed a weekly mythic keystone dungeon, and create accounts for multiple queries at once.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Raider.IO for a documented and accesible API.
